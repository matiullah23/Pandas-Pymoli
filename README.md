Here are the three trends I observed while conducting this analysis: 
1- This game is played primarily by males as over 81% of players identify themselves as males. 
2- The majority of players are between the age of 15 to 25. 62% of players are within these ages. 
3- This game marketing/advertising department should not target older gamers at all as only 3 out of our 780 players are over the age of 40
